INFO:Security:54 - 'xc6slx16' is a WebPack part.

WARNING:Pack:1653 - At least one timing constraint is impossible to meet because component delays alone exceed the constraint. A timing
   constraint summary below shows the failing constraints (preceded with an Asterisk (*)). Please use the Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE
   (command line) with the Mapped NCD and PCF files to identify which constraints and paths are failing because of the component delays
   alone. If the failing path(s) is mapped to Xilinx components as expected, consider relaxing the constraint. If it is not mapped to
   components as expected, re-evaluate your HDL and how synthesis is optimizing the path. To allow the tools to bypass this error, set the
   environment variable XIL_TIMING_ALLOW_IMPOSSIBLE to 1.


   For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing Analyzer Reference manual; for more information on TRCE,
   consult the Xilinx Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
INFO:Timing:3386 - Intersecting Constraints found and resolved.  For more 
   information, see the TSI report.  Please consult the Xilinx Command Line 
   Tools User Guide for information on generating a TSI report.
INFO:Timing:3284 - This timing report was generated using estimated delay 
   information.  For accurate numbers, please refer to the post Place and Route 
   timing report.
Number of Timing Constraints that were not applied: 1

Asterisk (*) preceding a constraint indicates it was not met.
   This may be due to a setup or hold violation.

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
